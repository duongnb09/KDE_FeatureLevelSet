# KDE_FeatureLevelSet
CUDA Code to compute the KDE and Feature Level Set. Those are two computation steps in the coherent structure extraction pipeline which is presented in the paper [A Visualization Framework for Multi-scale Coherent Structures in Taylor-Couette Turbulence](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33026991/) by Nguyen D., et al
